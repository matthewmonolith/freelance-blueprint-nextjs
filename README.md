## **Overview**

Many local businesses in Hessle and Hull lack an online presence, and an online shop could greatly benefit them. To support this, I’ve developed pivotal server-side functionalities, including creating products, managing carts, and processing orders. I chose Next.js for its integration of React, TypeScript, and server actions, allowing for smooth communication between the front-end and back-end. Additionally, I’ve set up a foundational front-end that’s easy to customize and extend based on specific needs.
